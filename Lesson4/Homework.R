#Test the Law of Large Numbers for N random normally distributed numbers
#with mean = 0, stdev = 1;

#Create an R script that will count how many of these numbers fall 
#between -1 and 1, and divide by the total quantity of N

#You know that E(X) = 68.2%

#Check that Mean(Xn) -> E(X) as you rerun your script while increasing N
